# Order-Organizer
Organizes restaurant orders into a queued list and accesses tables that are available until orders are terminated

** Run 'main.java' to run this project **

Currently, the Restaurant.java script will create a set of tables statically, but these can be modified.
Also, Orders are entered directly in the main method, but these can also be modified.
